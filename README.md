# Analysis of Gene Expression Differentiation Following Environmental Stressors

Next generation sequencing has provided opportunities to understand the molecular and genomic consequences of climate change induced environmental stressors on organisms. Specifically, RNA-seq has enabled us to understand what genes are being up- or down-regulated in response to these stressors. By analyzing gene expression data, we have a much greater understanding of the physiological consequences that have been previously described in many model species. 


## Project Objectives

In this project, I intend to develop python scripts that will:
* Align RNA-seq reads to a reference genome
* Find differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
* Provide a GO enrichment analysis of those DEGs

To complete these objectives, I anticipate the use of several scripts (at least one per objective) that will involve the use of external packages.
